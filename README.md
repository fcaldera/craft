# Create React App From Template

Create React apps using custom templates. This is a wrapper of `create-react-app` so you can use all its power here. See the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more details.

## Quick Start

If you are using npm 5.2 or later, no installation is required. You can simply use `npx` to run Craft as follows:

```
$ npx -p craft-cli craft <project-directory> <template-url>
```

If you are using an older version of npm, you must install Craft and create-react-app before running:

```
$ npm install -g craft-cli
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ craft <project-directory> <template-url>
```

Craft will verify that create-react-app is available and warn you if you need to install it.

## Template

A template is simply a Git repository containing files that you wish to add to the project generated by create-react-app. There are no constraints on the contents of your templates. By default, all files will be copied from your template, overriding generated files with the same name, except for `node_modules`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `craft.spec`, and `.git`.

If your template contains a `package.json` file, the scripts and dependencies will be merged with the ones generated by create-react-app. Any other changes to sections defined in the generated file will be ignored, and any other sections not generated will be included.

### Spec file

Your template can include a spec file, named `craft.spec`, that customizes the application of the template to the project generated by create-react-app. Here is an example:

```
# A sample craft spec

.gitignore: ignore
public: ignore
src/App.css: delete
src/logo.svg: delete
src/serviceWorker.js: delete
```

This example specifies that the generated `.gitignore` file and `public` directory should be left unchanged, even if the template includes those files, and that the generated `App.css`, `logo.svg` and `serviceWorker.js` files in `src` should be deleted.

The spec file format is very simple. Each line is a `<path>: <directive>` pair, where the path specifies a file or directory relative to the project root, always uses forward slash (`/`) as a delimiter, and never has a leading or trailing slash. The directive is one of `delete`, `ignore`, or `replace`:

- **delete** deletes the file or directory from the generated project.
- **ignore** leaves the specified file or directory exactly as generated (or not) by create-react-app. A file or directory with the same name in the template is ignored.
- **replace** copies the file or directory from the template, replacing a generated file or directory with the same name, if one exists.

By default, `package.json` is merged; `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `craft.spec`, and `.git` are ignored, and everything else is replaced. You can specify any of these files in your spec file to override these defaults.

Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash (`#`) are ignored.
