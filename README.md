# Create React App From Template

Create React apps using custom templates. This is a wrapper of `create-react-app` so you can use all its power here. See the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more details.

## Quick Start

If you are using npm 5.2 or later, no installation is required. You can simply use `npx` to run Craft as follows:

```
$ npx -p craft-cli craft <project-directory> <template-url>
```

If you are using an older version of npm, you must install Craft and create-react-app before running:

```
$ npm install -g craft-cli
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ craft <project-directory> <template-url>
```

Craft will verify that create-react-app is available and warn you if you need to install it.

## Template
There is no assumptions on the template scaffolding. It can be literally anything. All the content will be merged with the files generated by default for `create-react-app` and overwritten in case your template has files with the same names, except for `node_modules`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.git` files and folders. They will be skept.

If your template contains a `package.json` file, the scripts and dependecies will be merged with the one generated for the app. All other sections won't be included.
